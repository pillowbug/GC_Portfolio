                <h3>Affini</h3>
                <p>Affini is a relationship manager aimed at helping people nurture new connections and maintain current ones. </p>
                <p>Built as part of a two-week product sprint at Le Wagon's bootcamp, Affini was built by me and three other team members to showcase everything we've learned over the course of the program. </p>
                <p>Affini was built using Ruby on Rails using Javascript, Ruby, and HTML/CSS. I developed the design system as well as the CSS framework that the team used to create different components. Designed from the ground up from building wireframes in Figma, all the way to deployment on Heroku. </p>

                <p>Developed over the course of one week, this marketplace app was our first group project, cementing our practices of pair programming, version control practices through Git and Github, as well as collaboration and the bootcamp curriculum. </p>

                <p>This is a personal project developed over the course of Le Wagon's full-stack development bootcamp. It was built to demonstrate many-to-many associations in a relational database. It was also an opportunity to demonstrate our design abilities and knowledge of front-end technologies. </p>
